# TechBlog

## Description

This project is a CMS-style blog site built for developers who want to publish articles, blog posts, and share their thoughts and opinions. The site offers user authentication, allowing users to create an account, log in, and manage their blog posts. Users can view, add, update, and delete their posts, as well as leave comments on existing posts.

Motivation for building this project was to create a platform that allows developers to easily share their knowledge and insights with the community. This project aims to solve the problem of having a simple, yet effective platform for tech-related content. Through this project, I learned how to implement user authentication, manage state in a React application, and handle CRUD operations in a full-stack application.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
